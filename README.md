# Amaizing Recipes
# Summary
 Created by the Amaizing Unicorn Team/Team 9, we created the Amaizing Recipes App for users to enter
 in their list of ingredients and then search for a recipe to make. Features the ability to swipe to search:
 after selecting a subset of ingredients from the full list, the user may just swipe from their Pantry to
 the next screen and the app will show the list of results; switching from showing a list of recipes by
 social rank or by nutrition, if recipe is searched by nutrition then there will be a bar graph that shows
 the nutrition facts; youtube videos for instructions; and many more.
